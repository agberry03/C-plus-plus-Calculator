# Overview

In this project, I am trying to learn the basics of the C++ language.

To do so, I wrote a simple math program that calculates the answers to randomized
math problems, gets the user's answer, and compares the two. It runs this in a loop for however
many problems the user requests. The program will output "correct!" or "incorrect." depending on if the calculated answer and the user's answer match.

My purpose for writing this program is to get a better handle on how programming with C++ works,
while still providing a decent challenge.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the Visual Studio Code IDE.

I used the C++ programming language and the C/C++ IntelliSense extension.
I also used the Prettier extension to quickly edit the spacing of code.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add the ability to track how many answers the user got right.
- Make it so the program can give the user a variety of problems, instead of only one type at a time.
- Find a way to make it so the DisplayMathProblems function doesn't have to pause after displaying the last problem.
- Make the DisplayProblem methods in each child of MathProblem less repetitive.
